# CSS:

CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows us to specify how our webpage is presented, from the style, layout, colors, etc. It works alongside a structured document, such as an HTML file, and converts its contents into a more visually apealling and usable form.

## Syntax:

CSS is a rule-based language, which means that we are assigning styles (the rules) to certain groups or certain elements in our page. For example, if I wanted to change the font and color of all my headings, I would write:

> h2 {
>     font-family: cursive;
>     color: yellow;
> }
