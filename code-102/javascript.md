# Javascript:

Javascript is a lightweight/interpreted/just-in-time compiled programming language that has first-class functions. It is used in a variety of things, but it is most known as the scripting language for webpages. It is prototype-based, and supports a range of programming styles. Javascript runs client-side, which means it can be used to program the behavior of webpage elements in response to an event, such as a mouse click.

## Javascript Variables:

In Javascript, variables are containers for storing data/values.

We can declare a variable in Javascript in 3 ways: 'var', 'let', and 'const'. Let us look at 'var' for now. For example:

> var x = 7;

> var y = 2;

> var z = 9;
