# Cheat Sheet

## Chosing a Text Editor:

While there are a lot of text editors out there to choose from, there is no definitive "best". The best text editor for you is the one you enjoy using the most.

Some important factors to consider when choosing a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, colors/themes, and extension compatibility.

- Code completion is sort of like an auto-correct/auto-complete function. When you start typing something, it will give you options to auto-complete based on what you have typed, which can save you time and prevent typos. Some text editors will even close tags, brackets, or quotation marks for you, which is great quality of life.
- Syntax highlighting helps distinguish each element of your text by using certain colors for each type. For instance, tags may be colored orange, while regular text is colored white. This makes it easier to see what's in your text, and also makes it easier to spot potential sources of error.
- Colors and Themes will help relieve eye stress by using darker colors, but are also just fun ways to personalize your experience.
- Extensions can add extra functionality to your text editor, which can increase your productivity and quality of life.
