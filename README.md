# Having a Growth Mindset (and Why it's Important!)

The growth mindset is one where challenges and adversity are not seen as roadblocks, but as opportunities to learn and grow, hence the name. It can apply to anything in life, but it is especially useful in the land of coding, where there is so much to learn and lots of ways to get stuck. As such, being able ride through these bumpy patches and bounce back is the key to success.

One important thing about the growth mindset is that it helps you keep things in perspective. While you might be struggling with something right now, if you perservere and put in the effort to learn, you WILL improve. Remember, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Even if you airball your first few attempts, you're putting in the work to get to that next level. Keeping this in mind during the struggle is integral to the growth mindset. Failure isn't the end of the world. Instead, it is a chance to pick yourself up and start again, armed with the knowlege of your past mistakes.
