# Having a Growth Mindset (and Why it's Important!)  

### Quick Intro:

My name is Ian Venzon. I live in California, and am currently a community college student studying computer science. Nice to meet you all!

The growth mindset is one where challenges and adversity are not seen as roadblocks, but as opportunities to learn and grow, hence the name. It can apply to anything in life, but it is especially useful in the land of coding, where there is so much to learn and lots of ways to get stuck. As such, being able ride through these bumpy patches and bounce back is the key to success.

One important thing about the growth mindset is that it helps you keep things in perspective. While you might be struggling with something right now, if you perservere and put in the effort to learn, you **WILL** improve. Remember: *You miss 100% of the shots you don't take*. Even if you airball your first few attempts, you're putting in the work to get to that next level. Keeping this in mind during the struggle is integral to the growth mindset. Failure isn't the end of the world. Instead, it is a chance to pick yourself up and start again, armed with the knowlege of your past mistakes.

## Here are three things you should keep in mind in order to maintain a growth mindset:

1. ***If you are facing a tough problem, don't run away!*** Instead, face it head on, knowing that even if you struggle, you're still learning from it.
2. ***The growth mindset is an active mindset.*** You will need to put in the effort to maintain it.
3. ***Avoid comparing yourself to others.*** While it may be tempting to feel envious of someone else's achievements, this can impede your own growth. Instead of feeling jealous, it is better to acknowledge that they have worked hard to get where they are, and use this as a source of motivation for yourself.

# Markdown Notes:

In Markdown, there are often several different ways to do the same thing. However, due to convention, some ways are preferable to others in certain situations.  

For instance, if you want to make your text bold, you can either use two \* or \_ around your text, like this:

> \*\*this text is bold!\*\*

or

> \_\_this text is bold!\_\_

Both will lead to the same result: **this text is bold!**
