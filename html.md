## Wireframing

When designing a webpage, one very important practice to keep in mind is wireframing. 

Wireframing allows us to define and plan an information hierarchy for our site. The process of wireframing focuses on how we want a potential reader to process the information displayed on our page. Through deliberate positioning of elements such as buttons and menus, we can get to know how users will interact with our site. This is vital, as we want to make sure the foundation of our site is strong enough to hold on its own without any fancy bells and whistles. After all, if a user doesn't know how to navigate your website at a fundemental level, then any added pictures, fonts, or colors will only make things more confusing.

There are several ways to create a wireframe, but for beginners, a tried and true method is starting out with pen and paper, then switching to software later. This gives the best of both worlds, as pen/paper wireframes are much easier to modify and make big changes to, while software wireframes can help you sort out the finer details.

Before you start to make your wireframe, make sure you consider what you are designing in the first place. Depending on the task at hand, some wireframes may need more visual flair, while some wireframes should be more focused and to the point. In any case, as long as you create your wireframe that matches your needs, how you get there is not set in stone.

When creating a wireframe, there are 6 key steps:

1. **Do your research:** As mentioned previously, before you even start wireframing, make sure you understand what you are designing. Knowing your audience is also important, as you can search for trends/design elements that cater to said audience. Researching outside of your domain can also bring new ideas/perspectives that you may have never considered otherwise.

2. **Prepare your research for quick reference:** Your research may lead to you having a lot of data at your disposal. Instead of trying to comb through it, create a reference sheet with the most important details and goals. This will let you stay focused on creating your wireframe, as all you have to do is take a peek at your sheet when you get stuck.

3. **Make sure you have your user flow mapped out:** Wireframing can get messy quick if you aren't sure how much you will need to design. That's why it is important to really understand what your audience wants, as you can focus on their needs and cut out anything deemed unnecessary. The more self-sufficient a user can be when accessing your site, the better.

4. **Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate:** Now that we are using pen and paper, always keep in mind that this is an outline, not a final draft. Don't waste your time drawing detailed pictures or choosing colors. Instead, get your ideas on the page, organize them to your customer's needs, and keep track of where important information should be placed.

5. **Add some detail and get testing:** With your general outline/flow now on the page, we can start to add more detail. Start from top-to-bottom and left-to-right, considering what each element of your outline will need to do. It may be helpful to write some brief notes on the functionality/usability of things in your outline. Once you've gone through it all, now you can start user testing for feedback.

6. **Start turning your wireframes into prototypes:** After getting some proper feedback, now you can start working on the next step: changing your wireframe into a prototype. Here you can use tools that will transform your wireframe into a fully connected and working prototype, which can be used for even more user testing.
