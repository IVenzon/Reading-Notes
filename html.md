## Wireframing

When designing a webpage, one very important practice to keep in mind is wireframing. 

Wireframing allows us to define and plan an information hierarchy for our site. The process of wireframing focuses on how we want a potential reader to process the information displayed on our page. Through deliberate positioning of elements such as buttons and menus, we can get to know how users will interact with our site. This is vital, as we want to make sure the foundation of our site is strong enough to hold on its own without any fancy bells and whistles. After all, if a user doesn't know how to navigate your website at a fundemental level, then any added pictures, fonts, or colors will only make things more confusing.

There are several ways to create a wireframe, but for beginners, a tried and true method is starting out with pen and paper, then switching to software later. This gives the best of both worlds, as pen/paper wireframes are much easier to modify and make big changes to, while software wireframes can help you sort out the finer details.
